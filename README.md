### Enviroment variables

You need an .env file which contains the following variables for the configuration 
of the connection to your MySql database:

- DB_HOST
- DB_USER
- DB_PASSWORD
- DB_PORT
- DB_DATABASE

and lastly, in the same .env file, you must set a variable that specifies 
the port on which your server will run:

- PORT (for example port 4000)
